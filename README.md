### 💡 About Me
I’m passionate about applying **quantitative methods** to real-world financial markets.  
With a background in finance and treasury, I’m now focused on the intersection of **data, markets, and code** — exploring how mathematical models, backtesting frameworks, and automation can turn market inefficiencies into trading opportunities.

My journey blends **fundamental finance** with **quantitative analytics**, and every project I build reflects that goal: turning financial intuition into systematic strategy.
